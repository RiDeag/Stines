 Important
-----------

* This style is written for, and will only work with seaweedchan's 4chanX fork available [here] [1].

* You MUST have "Current" in your custom navigation.

* Hover over the current board title on the top left to view board list

* For the Quick reply to work properly, you must have "Persistent QR" and "Auto Hide QR" enabled.

* Open the Quick reply by pressing "i" close it by pressing esc.

* Hover your mouse on the right of the header bar to view the header shortcuts, hover the left to view your board list.

* Hover the bottom right of the replies to view the file info.

* Most likely doesn't work on Chrome. If it doesn't, quite frankly I don't want to work on it to get it to work on Chrome.

* This is currently a WIP. There are many many issues and the overall look may change. Be warned.


Installation (assuming Firefox)
-------------------------------

* Install the Stylish extension to manage your userstyles; once installed, just click on "Write New Style", give it a name, and paste the CSS there.
